Swap Consecutive Index Pairs
Given a list of integers nums, swap each consecutive even indexes with each other, 
and swap each consecutive odd indexes with each other.

Constraints
n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

Example 1
Input
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output
[2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 8]

0 and 2 gets swapped
1 and 3 gets swapped
