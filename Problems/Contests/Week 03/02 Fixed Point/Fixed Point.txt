Fixed Point

Given a list of unique integers nums sorted in ascending order, return the 
minimum i such that nums[i] == i. If there's no solution, return -1.

This should be done in \mathcal{O}(log(n))O(log(n)) time.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

Example 1
Input
nums = [-5, -2, 0, 3, 4]
Output
3
Explanation
Both nums[3] == 3 and nums[4] == 4 but 3 is smaller.

Example 2
Input
nums = [-5, -4, 0]
Output
-1
Explanation
There's no i such that nums[i] = i.

For sorted array, it hints for binary search
