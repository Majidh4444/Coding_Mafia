Invert Tree

Given a binary tree root, invert it so that its left subtree and right subtree are 
swapped and the children are recursively inverted.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in root

Example 1
Input
Visualize
root = [0, [2, null, null], [9, [7, null, null], [12, null, null]]]
Output
Visualize
[0, [9, [12, null, null], [7, null, null]], [2, null, null]]

Go through every node using DFS and swap their child
