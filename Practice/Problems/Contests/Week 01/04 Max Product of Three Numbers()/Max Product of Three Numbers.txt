Max Product of Three Numbers
Given a list of integers nums, find the largest product of three distinct elements.

Constraints
3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

Example 1
Input
nums = [5, 4, 1, 3, -2, -2]
Output
60
Explanation
We can multiply 5 * 4 * 3

Example 2
Input
nums = [-3, 1, 1, 0]
Output
0
Explanation
We can multiply 1 * 1 * 0
