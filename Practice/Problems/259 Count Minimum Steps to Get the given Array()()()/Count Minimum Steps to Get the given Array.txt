Count Minimum Steps to Get the given Array
In count minimum steps to get the given array problem, we have given an input array 
target[] containing n elements, we need to compute the minimum number of operations 
from converting array[] of size n with all zeros to target[].

Operations
a)    Increment an element by 1 is one operation.
b)    Double all the elements is one operation.


Example
a)
Input : target array -> [1,1]
Output: 2,
Increment 1 for both elements in [0, 0] to get [1, 1]-> 2 operations.

b)
Input : target array -> [2, 2]
Output: 3,
Increment 1 for both elements in [0, 0] to get [1, 1] -> 2 operations,
Double all the elements in [1, 1] to get [2, 2] -> 1 operation
Total = 3

c)
Input : target array -> [2,3]
Output: 4,
Increment 1 for both elements in [0, 0] to get [1, 1] -> 2 operations,
Double all the elements in [1, 1] to get [2, 2] -> 1 operation
Increment 1 for second element in [2, 2] to get [2, 3] -> 1 operation,
Total = 4

d)
Input : target array -> [4, 4, 5]
Output: 6,
Increment 1 for all elements in [0, 0, 0] to get [1, 1, 1] -> 3 operations,
Double all the elements in [1, 1, 1] to get [2, 2, 2] -> 1 operation
Double all the elements in [2, 2, 2] to get [4, 4, 4] -> 1 operation
Increment 1 in 3rd element in [4, 4, 4] to get [4, 4, 5] -> 1 operation,
Total = 6

Algorithm
Basic idea : Count number of steps in converting the given array to zero array. 
This is same as converting zero array to target array
1. Create a function to find minimum number of operations.
2. Initialize minimum moves (min_moves)= 0
3. Count the number of zeroes in the array, if the number of zeroes is equal to the 
size of the array then return min_moves.
4. Traverse in the array to find odd numbers, if an odd number found decreases the 
value by 1, increment min_moves by 1 and move forward until all the elements are 
even doing this.
5. If all elements are even, divide all elements by 2 and increment min_moves only 
once by 1.
6. until all the elements in the array are zeroes continue this.
7. On the given input target array call this function, print it. It is the minimum 
number of steps.
