// Suppose you make some profit p1 by doing your 
// first transaction in the stock market. Now you 
// are excited to purchase another stock to earn 
// more profit. Suppose the price of the second 
// stock you aim to buy is x. Now, for you, the 
// net effective price that you are spending from 
// your pocket for this stock will be x-p1, 
// because you already have p1 bucks in your hand. 
// Now, if you sell the second stock at price y 
// your net profit p2 will be p2 = y - (x-p1). 
// You have to do nothing but maximize this profit p2. Here's the code:
